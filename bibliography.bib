	abstract = {Lawley's selection theorem is applied to subpopulations derived from a parent in which the classical factor model holds for a specified set of variables. The results show that there exists an invariant factor pattern matrix that describes the regression of observed on factor variables in every subpopulation derivable by selection from the parent, given that selection does not occur directly on the observable variables and does not reduce the rank of the system. However, such a factor pattern matrix is not unique, which in turn implies that if a simple structure factor pattern matrix can be satisfactorily determined in one such subpopulation the same simple structure can be found in any subpopulation derivable by selection. The implications of these results for “parallel proportional profiles” and “factor matching” techniques are discussed.},
