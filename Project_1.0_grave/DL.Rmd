## Decision-Log
DL-Description:The decision-log is meant to be a documentation of the decisions that have been made along the way of this respective project. 
The list is aimed to be as extensive as possible, but makes no claim to be absolutely complete.
Several "types" of decisions are being distinguished: Theoretically driven ones, empirically driven ones, practicality driven ones as well as those that are arbitrary.
The idea behind that is not only to foster general transparency and documentation, but also to explicitly enable a better grasp of the researchers degrees of freedom
in simulation studies.
Note, that the decisions in the DL are numbered, not to depict the chronology of the decisions in the progress of this study, but to make explicit referral easier.
