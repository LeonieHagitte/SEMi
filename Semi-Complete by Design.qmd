## Why Care About Measurement Invariance?

Measurement invariance (MI) is a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons of latent constructs across groups [@Cheung2000; @Meredith1964].\
Violations of MI imply that observed group differences may reflect **measurement artifacts** rather than substantive differences in the underlying constructs[@Putnick2016].

Without MI, conclusions about group differences in means, variances, or relations are not statistically justified[@Putnick2016].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Care About Measurement Invariance?

-   Measurement invariance is often **implicitly assumed** rather than empirically tested\
-   The majority of psychological studies do **not test for MI** [@Maassen2025; @Rohrer2025]\
-   When MI is tested, reporting standards are frequently insufficient for replication [@Putnick2016; @Maassen2025]

As a result, the validity of many reported group comparisons remains unclear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Empirical Evidence on MI Violations

Recent literature reviews highlight the severity of the problem:

> *“None of the reported MI tests were reproducible, and only 26% of the 174 newly performed MI tests reached sufficient (scalar) invariance, with MI failing completely in 58% of tests.”*[@Maassen2025]

Additionally, in approximately **50% of cases** where configural invariance was rejected, the **number of latent factors differed between groups**, indicating fundamentally different measurement structures[@Maassen2025].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SEM Trees

Structural Equation Model (SEM) Trees integrate **confirmatory SEM** with **recursive partitioning**[@Brandmaier2013; @Brandmaier2016; @Arnold2021].

Key characteristics:

-   Automatically detect **heterogeneity in model parameters**\
-   Identify **subgroups** in which measurement or structural parameters differ\
-   Allow data-driven detection of **non-invariance**

SEM Trees are particularly useful when grouping variables are unknown or continuous and if you have plenty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advantages and Limitations of SEM Trees

**Strengths**

-   Flexible, exploratory identification of non-invariance\
-   Can handle complex interaction structures\
-   Transparent subgroup definitions\
-   Should perform well with sigmoid effects

**Limitations**

-   Risk of overfitting without cross-validation\
-   Results depend on splitting criteria\
-   Less suitable for strict confirmatory hypothesis testing\
-   The functional form could be harder to retrieve

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## MNLFA (Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis)

Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) extends traditional factor models by allowing:

-   Item parameters (loadings, intercepts)\
-   Factor means and variances

to vary **continuously** as functions of observed covariates (e.g., age, gender, SES). This means MI is conceptualized as the moderation of certain parameters/ the whole model by a external variable.

This therefore directly models measurement non-invariance instead of testing it sequentially.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strengths and Challenges of MNLFA

**Strengths**

-   Handles both categorical and continuous moderators\
-   Avoids arbitrary group discretization\
-   Provides fine-grained modeling of parameter variation\
-   Is suited for nonlinear relationships

**Limitations**

-   High model complexity\
-   Strong distributional and functional form assumptions\
-   Requires large sample sizes and careful model specification\

MNLFA is most appropriate when **theory** suggests **systematic moderation** of measurement parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exploratory vs. Confirmatory Approaches

So the question arises when to use which method for MI testing?

-   I would argue that this is a question of the substantive nature of your research question\
-   MI testing should be pursued with rigor and diligent documentation\
-   However it is not necessarily always a prerequisite to have **Residual Invariance** established\
-   So how far you are progessed in a theoretical foundation is key\
-   And what question you want to answer also determines the required invariance level\

## Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation to compare SEM trees and MNLFA


## Trial Run

## Questions & Concerns

-   How do I ensure that the comparison is fair, the best?
-   What conditions would you like to see simulated?
-   Did i forget something in the simukation set-up?
-   What makes a simulation most useful in your opinion?
